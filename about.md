DataShines is my personal endeavor to describe, discuss and uncover some basic to possibly advanced data-science personal projects, concepts, news.

### About me

I am Ashish Jha, Senior Data Scientist at Sentiance. Electrical Engineering Graduate from IITR, Computer Science Post-Graduate from EPFL, working in data-science/machine-learning for the last 4 years. Super-excited and slightly-skeptic at the same time about the machine learning progress, particularly deep learning. I care especially about the end-user impact of ML/AI (interpretability, explicability) as well as standardization of machine learning engineering procedures.
