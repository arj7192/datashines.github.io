DataShines is my personal endeavor to describe, discuss and uncover some basic to possibly advanced data-science personal projects, concepts, news.

### About me

I am Ashish Jha, Senior Data Scientist at [Tractable](https://tractable.ai/). Electrical Engineering Graduate from [IITR](https://www.iitr.ac.in/), Computer Science Post-Graduate from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/index.en.html), working in data-science/machine-learning for the last 4 years. Super-excited and slightly-skeptic at the same time about the machine learning progress, particularly deep learning. I care especially about the end-user impact of ML/AI (including interpretability, explicability) as well as standardization of machine-learning-engineering procedures.
