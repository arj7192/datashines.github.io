title: Analysis and Subsequent Optimization of a Microcontroller Program
---

Having received the prestigious [DAAD](https://www.daad.de/en/) Scholarship, I got to do
my Undergrad Summer Internship at [OVGU](https://www.uni-magdeburg.de/en/), Magdeburg, 
Germany,
on this interesting topic: *Analysis and Subsequent Optimization of a Microcontroller Program for precise control of Pneumatic Valves used for Hot Wire Chemical Vapor Depositionâ€¨*
I managed to modify an already existing program to increase the precision of the valves
were actuated based on the microcontroller board multiplexed outputs.


### Presentation

Here is the full presentation discussing my approach and throwing some light on the details
of the code that was modified:
