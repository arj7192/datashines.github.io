title: Eye Tracking Measures for Anthropomorphism in Humanâ€¨ Robot Interaction
---

Anthropomorphism is our tendency to attribute human like characteristics to non-humans animate or inanimate.
In this study, I had the task of analysing anthropomorphism via eye-gaze patterns as a human
observed (i) human performing a task, vs, (ii) robot performing the same task.

We got exciting results, one being the validation of novelty effect, i.e. we tend to 
focus on a robot's hands or legs while it performs a task, but when a human performs
a task, we tend to focus on her head.


### Report

Here is the full presentation discussing how the experiment was designed, how did the gaze
data look like, what were the results and conclusions:

 As a reference, here are the 3 tasks that the robot performed in the experiment. 
 Participants of the experiment were asked to watch these,
 while we were recording their eye-gaze data. A human then performed the same 3 tasks
 the experiment was accordingly repeated.
