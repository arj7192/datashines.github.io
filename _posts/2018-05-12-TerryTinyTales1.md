> Loktantra calls customer care

* Rajneeti : How may I help you ?
* Loktantra : Hi, I recently got my account recharged but can't make a call
* Rajneeti : Let me check sir... _<after 5 hours>_ ... sir actually you might have recharged another account, perhaps by mistake
* Loktantra : Nope, I am damn sure, it was this account.
* Rajneeti : Then, please go and file a complaint with the consumer court.
* Loktantra : Hey, I have bought your product, and you ain't helping me, that's not fair !
* Rajneeti : Sir, we are just following the rules. Okay, if you recharge now for 420, you will get you services back immediately ;)
