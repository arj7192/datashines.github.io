title: Fundamentals of Finite Difference Methods
---


I had the opportunity to present on this topic at the 10th Indo German Winter Academy, 2011. 
Discrete mathematics has been one of my favorite areas of study in Mathematics. I was glad 
to be able to apply what I learned here later while studying Computer Graphics at 
[EPFL](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/introduction-to-computer-graphics-CS-341). 


### Presentation

Here is the full presentation discussing FDMs and discussing their consistency, stability 
and convergence:
